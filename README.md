- 👋 Hi, I’m @wellsbells85
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, hockey, cats, and being a dedicated father.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Javascript, CSS, and JUnit. Refreshing my HTML, PHP, and SQL knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications for restaurants. Someday would love to have a versatile POS system that is user friendly, but still relatively robust for the average Chef/GM/Restarantuer. Not and easy task, but up to the challenge when I have enough skills built up.
