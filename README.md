- 👋 Hi, I’m @wellsbells85, but you can also call me Nicholas (preferably), Nick, or Wellsters.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking (I've probably made 500,000+ pizzas in my life), hockey (Let's Go PENS!), cats (My cat's name is Bajim, which is Mayan for "to take with force", and being a dedicated father to my daughter Moxie! 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Javascript, CSS, and JUnit. Refreshing my HTML, PHP, and SQL knowledge. Hoping that as I gain more experience and connections people will help me improve my code so I can learn more through GitHub. I'm also using this as a tool to finad all the things I don't know that I don't know by seeing what other people have and what I'm lacking in my projects (like basic README). 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications for restaurants. Someday would love to have a versatile POS system that is user friendly, but still relatively robust for the average Chef/GM/Restarantuer. Not and easy task, but up to the challenge when I have enough skills built up. I'm also working on building fun games that I can modify and play with my daughter as she gets older and screen time becomes more relavent in her life. Hopefully she'll be interested in STEM like her parents, but can pursue it from an earlier age and get a jump on a great career from an early age. Her mom and I spend over a decade in hospitality, which were wonderful experiences, but we have a lot of catching up to do to be as good of programmers as we hope to be.
